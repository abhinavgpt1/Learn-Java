        // BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out) // creates a buffered output stream with a default buffer size = 8192 bytes = 8KB
        // BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out, int bufferSize) // creates a buffered output stream with a specified buffer size
            // unlike FileOutputStream, there is no option to open in append mode, which makes sense to include in FileOutputStream only,
            // since it is related to handling files, whereas BufferedOutputStream is general purpose O/P stream (not just for handling files, eg. network etc).

        // methods
        // void write(int b) // writes a single byte to the output stream
        // void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) // writes len bytes from the specified byte array b, starting at offset off
            // void write(byte[] b) // writes the entire byte array b to the output stream, but this doesn't belong to BufferedOutputStream, and is defined in FilterOutputStream
        // synchronized void flush() // forces any buffered data to be written to the underlying output stream

            // Q- what happens if buffer is almost full, say 20 bytes left, and I try writing 50 bytes?
            // A- Immediately, write happens taking the 20 from 50. Rest 30 bytes are stored in buffer. Hence, it is a good practice to flush (atleast in c++ I see now).
