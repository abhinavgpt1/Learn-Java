/**
 * FAQ: Calling a thread's run() method directly, instead of using the start() method, defeats the purpose of multithreading.
 * Here's why:
 * No New Thread Creation:
 *  When run() is called directly, it executes as a regular method call within the current thread of execution (e.g., the main thread). No new thread is created by the operating system or the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 * Synchronous Execution:
 *  The code within the run() method will execute synchronously, meaning it will block the current thread until its completion. This eliminates the concurrency that is the primary benefit of using threads.
 * Loss of Multithreading Benefits:
 *  The goal of multithreading is to allow multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving responsiveness and potentially performance. Calling run() directly prevents this parallelism, as the tasks will still execute sequentially within a single thread.
 * 
 * In contrast, the start() method:
 * Spawns a New Thread:
 *  The start() method is responsible for creating a new thread of execution in the operating system.
 * Schedules for Execution:
 *  It then schedules this new thread with the JVM, which will eventually call the run() method within the context of this newly created thread when resources and CPU time are available.
 * Enables Concurrency:
 *  This allows the run() method's code to execute concurrently with the original thread, achieving true multithreading.
