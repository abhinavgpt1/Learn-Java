     * The entire theory on synchronization you need is as follows:
     * -------------------------------------------------------------
     * We can use the synchronized keyword on different levels:
     *  Instance methods
     *  Static methods
     *  Code blocks
     * 
     * When we use a synchronized block, Java internally uses a monitor, also known as a monitor lock or intrinsic lock, to provide synchronization. 
     * These monitors are bound to an object; therefore, all synchronized blocks of the same object can have only one thread executing them at the same time.
     * 
     * A lock can be on an instance of a class or on the class itself.
     * Lock on instance comes in picture for synchronized instance methods and synchronized blocks synchronized on "this" / instance. eg. synchronized(this) {}
     * Lock on class comes in picture for synchronized static methods and synchronized blocks synchronized on the class object. eg. synchronized(ClassName.class) {}
     * 
     * More on synchronized block:
     * ---------------------------
     * synchronized(X.class) {}
     *  Locks on the class object (the metadata object for class X).
     *  There is only one class object per JVM for each class.
     *  If you use synchronized(X.class), all threads across all instances of X must wait for the lock on the class object.
     *  When to use: This is useful for static methods or when you want to synchronize access to resources shared by "all instances".
     * 
     * synchronized(this) {}
     *  Locks on the current "instance" of class (this).
     *  Each instance of a class has its own lock.
     *  Only one thread per "instance" can enter a synchronized(this) block at a time.
     *  IMP: Other threads can enter the block for other instances simultaneously.
     *  When to use: Use this when you want to protect instance-specific data.
     * 
     * Extra:
     * ------
     * Process synchronization != thread synchronization
     * Definition: Mutual exlcusion states that "no two processes can exist in the critical section at any given point of time". The term was first coined by Dijkstra.

        //      This “race” can lead to incorrect results or unpredictable behavior because the order of execution is not controlled.

        // Def: Mutual exclusion = mutex: A mutex is like a lock that ensures only one process can access a resource at a time.

/**
 * Extra: Mutex and Semaphore in java
 * Good read: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/mutex-vs-semaphore/
 * Mutex
 * -----
 * In Java, there is no built-in class explicitly named Mutex. The functionality of a mutex can be achieved using two main constructs:
 *  synchronized keyword: This language-level construct provides mutual exclusion for methods or code blocks.
 *      Usage:  The JVM automatically handles the acquisition and release of the lock, even if an exception occurs. 
 *              It is simple and straightforward but lacks advanced features.
 *  ReentrantLock class: This class from the java.util.concurrent.locks package offers a more flexible and robust locking mechanism.
 *      ReentrantLock offers more advanced features than the synchronized keyword.
 *      Features:
 *      Timed lock acquisition: tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
 *      Interruptible lock acquisition: lockInterruptibly()
 *      Fairness policy: Can be set to grant access to the longest-waiting thread 
 * 
 * Semaphore in Java
 * -----------------
 * Java provides the java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class, which manages a counter of permits. 
 * Core concept: A semaphore controls access to resources by maintaining a count of available "permits." 
 * Threads request a permit to access the resource and release it when they are finished.
 * Types of Semaphores:
 *  Counting Semaphore: Initialized with a count greater than 1, it manages a pool of multiple resources.
 *  Binary Semaphore: Initialized with a single permit, it can be used to provide mutual exclusion, similar to a mutex. However, a binary semaphore does not track ownership, so a different thread can release the permit.
 * Syntax:
 * -------
 * import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;
 * 
 * public class SemaphoreExample {
 *     // Allow up to 3 threads to access the resource at a time
 *     private final Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3);
 * 
 *     public void useResource() throws InterruptedException {
 *         semaphore.acquire(); // Acquire a permit
 *         try {
 *             // Critical section (limited to 3 threads)
 *         } finally {
 *             semaphore.release(); // Release the permit
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
